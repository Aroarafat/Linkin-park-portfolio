            <p class="park"> Linkin Park is an American rock band from Agoura Hills, California. The band's current
                lineup
                comprises
                vocalist/rhythm guitarist/keyboardist Mike Shinoda, lead guitarist Brad Delson, bassist Dave Farrell,
                DJ/turntablist
                Joe Hahn and drummer Rob Bourdon, all of whom are founding members. Vocalists Mark Wakefield and Chester
                Bennington
                are former members of the band. Categorized as alternative rock, Linkin Park's earlier music spanned a
                fusion of
                heavy metal and hip hop, while they later transitioned into more electronica- and pop-influenced music.
